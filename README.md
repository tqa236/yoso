## Constraints

Time constraints will significantly impact the approach

- If the image needs to be rendered in near real time (for example, if a client uploads an image to the website to check if a garment suits them or not): fast solution is preferred
- If time is not a constraint (but mainly labor cost): We can opt for a solution that gives the best possible quality.
